### Horizon Symmetries and Black Hole Entropy
#### Steven Carlip (University of California, Davis — USA)

### Hadamard States and Black Holes: A story written at infinity
#### Claudio Dappiaggi (University of Pavia — Italy)
We review the cornerstones of a longstanding programme aimed at constructing Hadamard states for free quantum fields on asymptotically flat spacetimes by exploiting invariance under the action of the BMS asymptotic symmetry group. In particular we outline how this procedure has been used to give a rigorous construction of the Unruh state for a massless, conformally coupled, real scalar field on Schwarzschild spacetime and we survey its application to higher spin, free fields. To conclude we examine the future perspectives on the interplay between Hadamard states, algebraic quantum field theory and black hole physics.

### 2D Moving-Mirror Models Revisited: Equivalence Principle, Conformal Invariance, and Their Limitations
#### Stephen A. Fulling (Texas A&M University — USA)
Because all two-dimensional space-times are conformally flat and most massless field equations are conformally invariant, exact solutions are easy to find, even for reflection boundary conditions on arbitrary timelike curves ("mirror trajectories").  Such models played an important role in establishing the paradigm of quantum field theory in curved space-time in the 1970s, and they have recently reattracted attention in connection with radiation from black holes or their near environs.  The critical issues (not yet completely solved even for classical fields) are the correct formal definition and degree of physical reality of "radiation" when source and detector are in relative acceleration.  One arrives at apparently paradoxical conclusions such as that a stationary mirror radiates from the perspective of an accelerated observer.  Our conclusion is that such statements are correct (and necessary to satisfy principles of equivalence and general covariance), but one must be careful about combining them too literally with our flat-space and classical intuitions.

My principal collaborators in this work have been Paul Davies in the 1970s and Justin Wilson in the 2010s; Bill Unruh and Marlan Scully have had major influences.

### Particle detectors and purification partners for the observed particles
#### Masahiro Hotta (Tohoku University — Japan)
In quantum field theory, the term "particle" is defined as that which is observed by a particle detector, as emphasized by Unruh and DeWitt. We present a general formula for determining a complementary purification particle corresponding to the particle observed by the detector.

### Black Hole Chemistry
#### David Kubiznak (Charles University — Czechia, University of Waterloo and Perimeter Institute — Canada)
The mass of a black hole has traditionally been identified with its energy. We describe a new perspective on black hole thermodynamics, one that identifies the mass of a black hole with chemical enthalpy, and the cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure. This leads to an understanding of black holes from the viewpoint of chemistry, in terms of concepts such as Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points. Both charged and rotating black holes exhibit novel chemical-type phase behaviour, hitherto unseen

### Information flows, entanglement and communication in the presence of black holes
#### Eduardo Martín-Martínez (University of Waterloo and Perimeter Institute — Canada)
In this talk we will review several aspects of how information and correlations flow through quantum fields in the presence of black holes. We will focus on entanglement harvesting (the extraction of entanglement from a quantum field vacuum) and quantum communication in regions of strong curvature. We will use these results to gain some insight on how information is stored in quantum fields in the presence of strong gravity and horizons and what can relativistic quantum information teach us about them.

### Quantum Switch on a Superposition of Spherical Shells
#### Nelson Yokomizo (Federal University of Minas Gerais — Brazil)
A characteristic generally expected to hold in a theory of quantum gravity is the existence of states describing superpositions of distinct geometries. Phenomenological models have recently been explored for the analysis of possible effects due to a superposition of geometries, including the occurrence of processes with indefinite order. In particular, in a gravitational quantum switch, the order of operations applied by two agents on a target system is entangled with the state of the geometry. We consider a model describing the superposition of geometries produced by distinct
arrangements of spherical mass shells, and show that a protocol for the implementation of a gravitational quantum switch can be formulated in such a system. The geometries in superposition are identical in an exterior region outside a given radius, and differ within such a radius. The exterior region provides a classical frame with a definite geometry from which the superposition of geometries in the interior region can be probed. One of the agents crosses the interior region and becomes entangled with the geometry, which is explored as a resource for the implementation of the quantum switch.

### Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Flow for a Particle Detector
#### Níckolas de Aguiar Alves (Federal University of ABC — Brazil)
The functional renormalization group is a powerful tool to study nonperturbative physics, but it has not been much explored within quantum field theory in curved spacetime yet. On the other hand, particle detectors are an omnipresent tool within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and relativistic quantum information but are often treated only perturbatively. In this paper, we present the first computation of the functional renormalization group flow for a particle detector. The chosen model is an inertial Unruh–DeWitt detector in Minkowski spacetime, for simplicity. A new development in heat kernel techniques—the Taylor trick—is necessary to perform the calculations and it is important to carefully choose cutoffs that diverge at the ultraviolet limit in order to keep the beta functions finite. We compare our results with the MS-bar results at one-loop and find that both computations agree qualitatively, as expected.

### Entanglement from rotating black holes in thermal baths
#### Ivan Agullo (Louisiana State University — USA)
The question of how much entanglement is produced during Hawking's evaporation process has primarily been investigated mostly for spherically symmetric black holes in isolation. However, most black holes in our universe are spinning, and exist within a thermal environment—the cosmic microwave background. In this presentation, I will describe how black hole spin and the thermal environment impact the generation of entanglement. The predictions are suitable for experimental testing in the laboratory using analog platforms.

### Quantum signatures of black hole mass superpositions
#### Joshua Foo (Stevens Institute of Technology — USA)
We present a new operational framework for studying “superpositions of spacetimes,” which are of fundamental interest in the development of a theory of quantum gravity. Our approach capitalizes on nonlocal correlations in curved spacetime quantum field theory, allowing us to formulate a metric for spacetime superpositions as well as characterizing the coupling of particle detectors to a quantum field. We apply our approach to analyze the dynamics of a detector (using the Unruh-deWitt model) in a spacetime generated by a Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole in a superposition of masses. We find that the detector exhibits signatures of quantum-gravitational effects corroborating and extending Bekenstein’s seminal conjecture concerning the quantized mass spectrum of black holes in quantum gravity. Crucially, this result follows directly from our approach, without any additional assumptions about the black hole mass properties.

### The four laws of spacetime thermodynamics
#### Arno Keppens (Space Pole, Brussels — Belgium)
Bardeen, Carter, and Hawking presented the four laws of black hole thermodynamics fifty years ago, in 1973. Only 45 years later, in 2018, Wang and Braunstein rigorously demonstrated that surfaces away from horizons are not thermodynamic, unless they are spherically symmetric. This entails that the laws of black hole thermodynamics can only be generalized to surfaces that are concentric with black hole horizons. Assuming the Schwarzschild metric, this generalization is achieved with a twist: By equating two temperature definitions that should simultaneously hold for an equilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime's degrees of freedom, it is immediately found that the latter only applies to surfaces with constant Newtonian gravitational potential. The laws of thermodynamics can correspondingly be rephrased in terms of spacetime's state variables at these surfaces. Note: This work elaborates on an essay written for the Gravity Research Foundation 2023 Awards for Essays on Gravitation, which was awarded an Honorable Mention.

### Path Integrals on Curved Spacetime: the case for second order geometry
#### Folkert Kuipers (LMU Munich — Germany)
The search for a theory that consistently combines quantum theory with general relativity forces us to consider geometrical frameworks beyond standard (first order) differential geometry. One candidate for such a generalized geometrical framework is second order (stochastic) differential geometry, which incorporates a violation of Leibniz rule, that is characteristic to the Wiener integral, into the geometry. This feature makes the framework an ideal tool in the study of covariant path integrals on curved spacetimes.
In this talk, I will review the basic ingredients of this framework in both a Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. Here, I will pay particular attention to the deformations of spacetime symmetries that arise due to the coupling of quantum fluctuations to the affine connection. Finally, I will discuss some connections to non-commutative geometry.

### Quantum energy inequalities in integrable models
#### Jan Mandrysch (FAU Erlangen — Germany)
Many results in general relativity rely crucially on classical energy conditions. This includes for instance singularity theorems a la Hawking and Penrose which predict the formation of black holes. Quantum matter, however, violates these conditions since the energy density can fluctuate and in particular become arbitrarily negative at a point. 
A reminiscent notion of stability can be captured by weaker conditions often referred to as quantum (weak) energy inequalities (QEIs). Such inequalities have been proven in many free QFT models and in some cases lead to similar singularity theorems as for classical matter.

However, there exist only few results in interacting theories. A first step in this direction is to find QEI bounds in QFT without gravity. Here we will focus on a certain class of two-dimensional interacting QFTs known as "integrable models". In particular, we present results on the O(N)-nonlinear-sigma and sinh-Gordon model at one- and two-particle level.

The talk is partly based on [2302.00063](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00063).

### Asymptotic quasinormal modes of string-theoretical d-dimensional black holes
#### Filipe Moura (Instituto Universitário de Lisboa — Portugal)
We compute the quasinormal frequencies of d-dimensional large spherically symmetric black holes with Gauss-Bonnet corrections in the highly damped regime. We solve perturbatively the master differential equation and we compute the monodromies of the master perturbation variable (analytically continued to the complex plane) in different contours, in order to obtain the quasinormal mode spectra. We consider tensorial, vectorial and scalar gravitational perturbations, obtaining the same frequencies for the three cases like in Einstein gravity.

### Unpacking Black Hole Complementarity
#### Siddharth Muthukrishnan (University of Pittsburgh — USA)
To what extent does the black hole information paradox lead to violations of quantum mechanics? I explain how black hole complementarity provides a framework to articulate how quantum characterizations of black holes can remain consistent despite the information paradox. I point out that there are two ways to cash out the notion of consistency in play here: an operational notion and a descriptive notion. These two ways of thinking about consistency lead to (at least) two principles of black hole complementarity: an operational principle and a descriptive principle. Our background philosophy of science regarding realism/instrumentalism might initially lead us to prefer one principle over the other. However, the recent physics literature, which applies tools from quantum information theory and quantum computational complexity theory to various thought experiments involving quantum systems in or around black holes, implies that the operational principle is successful where the descriptive principle is not. This then lets us see that for operationalists the black hole information paradox might no longer be pressing.

### Noncommutative correction to black hole entropy
#### Filip Pozar (Institute Ruder Boskovic — Croatia)
Noncommutative geometry is an established candidate for modeling aspects of quantum gravity.
We will outline the calculation of the correction to black hole entropy due to noncommutative geometry in the Brick wall approach and find logarithmic corrections, providing evidence to the claim that noncommutative spacetime encapsulates quantum effects of the spacetime.

### Light-cone thermodynamics: purification of the Minkowski vacuum
#### Salvatore Ribisi (CPT–Marseille — France)
We explicitly express the Minkowski vacuum of a massless scalar field in terms of the particle notion associated with suitable spherical conformal killing fields. These fields are orthogonal to the light wavefronts originating from a sphere with a radius of rH in flat spacetime: a bifurcate conformal killing horizon that exhibits semiclassical features similar to those of black hole horizons and Cauchy horizons of non-extremal spherically symmetric black holes. Our result highlights the quantum aspects of this analogy and extends the well-known decomposition of the Minkowski vacuum in terms of Rindler modes, which are associated with the boost Killing field normal to a pair of null planes in Minkowski spacetime (the basis of the Unruh effect). While some features of our result have been established by Kay and Wald’s theorems in the 90s—on quantum field theory in stationary spacetimes with bifurcate Killing horizons—the added value we provide here lies in the explicit expression of the vacuum.

### The Idealization Paradox in Hawking Radiation
#### Dominic Ryder (London School of Economics — United Kingdom)
In this talk I argue that three mainstream derivations of Hawking radiation all contain an unresolved paradox. These are Hawking’s original derivation (1975), Fredenhagen and Haag’s mathematically “watertight” derivation (1990), and the algebraic approach (Dimock and Kay, 1987). The paradox is due to the fact that the derivations are carried out in a spacetime which does not model black hole evaporation whereas, given the existence of Hawking radiation, black holes are expected to evaporate. Therefore, one should be able to deidealize the derivations and carry them out on spacetimes which model black hole evaporation. However, assumptions essential for the derivations breakdown in evaporation spacetimes, and so it appears the idealization of non-evaporation is essential for these derivations. 

I first present and defend the existence of the idealization paradox by showing that for all three approaches, assumptions necessary for them to be carried out breakdown in evaporation spacetimes. Hawking himself recognized this problem and proposed an approximation regime to respond to it. Therefore, I next describe this proposal and argue that for each derivation it is non-trivial to show that Hawking radiation can be recovered in the approximation regime. For Hawking’s derivation the prospects of success for the approximation regime are very limited; for Fredenhagen and Haag’s the prospects are better; and for the algebraic approach the prospects are good.

Finally, canvas possible resolutions to the idealization paradox and argue that, given a resolution, we may learn about: the operation of idealizations in physics, how global structure encodes local structure in general relativity, the nature of Hawking radiation, and how science uses models to make progress. 

### Holographic Einstein Rings of a Black Hole in Massive Gravity
#### Rabia Saleem (COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus — Pakistan)
In the context of holography, the Einstein ring of an AdS black hole (BH) in massive gravity (MG) is depicted. An oscillating Gaussian source on one side of the AdS boundary propagates in bulk, and we impose a response function to explain it. Using a wave optics imaging system, we obtain the optical appearance of the Einstein ring. Our research reveals that the ring can change into a luminosity-deformed ring or light spots depending on the variation of parameters and observational positions. When observers are positioned at the north pole, the holographic profiles always appear as a ring with concentric stripe surroundings, and a bright ring appears at the location of the photon sphere of the BH. The amplitude of the lensed response function $|\langle O\rangle|$ increases with the increasing values of the graviton parameter $m$, for the fixed value of the horizon $u_{e}$. On the other hand, the amplitude of the lensed response function $|\langle O\rangle|$ decreases with the increasing values of the horizon $u_{e}$, for the fixed value of graviton parameter $m$. These differences are also reflected in the Einstein ring, where the intensities and the locations of the Einstein ring significantly vary according to the numerical values of the involved parameters. These findings are also observed in the brightness profiles and the best fit comparison between the results obtained by wave optics and geometric optics for different values of graviton parameter $m$. 

### QFT in Non-smooth Spacetimes
#### Yafet Erasmo Sanchez Sanchez (University of Genoa — Italy)
Quantum Field Theory (QFT) offers a robust framework for understanding the universe at a microscopic level. However, its traditional formulation relies on the assumption of smooth spacetime—an idealization that fails in the context of certain astrophysical models and self-gravitating fluids.

In this talk, I will explore the extension of QFT to accommodate non-smooth spacetimes. I will outline the primary concepts involved in the algebraic quantization of the free scalar field. The construction of observables will draw from the findings presented in arXiv:[1910.13789](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13789), while the discussion of states will reference arXiv:[2207.01429](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01429).

### AdS/BCFT correspondence and BTZ black hole entropy within Horndeski gravity
#### Fabiano Francisco dos Santos (Federal University of Maranhão — Brazil)
This talk presents some results results of the BTZ black hole thermodynamics. These were performed by gravity duals of conformal field theories with boundaries$-$ known as AdS/BCFT correspondence. Through holographic renormalization, the free energy is obtained and with it, the other thermodynamic quantities are derived. Beyond these results, the Hawking-Page phase transition was computed to show the stable and unstable phases throughout the plane of free energy versus temperature.

### Holographic Dual of Extended Black Hole Thermodynamics
#### Manus Visser (University of Cambridge — United Kingdom)
We establish a novel exact holographic dictionary between the laws of extended black hole thermodynamics in Anti-de Sitter Space and the thermodynamic laws of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). We formulate the CFT first law that is exactly dual to the first law of extended black hole thermodynamics with variable cosmological constant but fixed Newton’s constant. Moreover, we find the holographic dual of the Smarr relation for AdS black holes, coined the 'holographic Euler relation'. On the field theory side we include two independent pairs of thermodynamic conjugate variables: the central charge-chemical potential term and the pressure-volume term. In this setting we uncover various new phase transitions and critical behaviour in the CFT.
