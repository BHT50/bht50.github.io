### Hadamard States and Black Holes: A story written at infinity
#### Claudio Dappiaggi (University of Pavia — Italy)
We review the cornerstones of a longstanding programme aimed at constructing Hadamard states for free quantum fields on asymptotically flat spacetimes by exploiting invariance under the action of the BMS asymptotic symmetry group. In particular we outline how this procedure has been used to give a rigorous construction of the Unruh state for a massless, conformally coupled, real scalar field on Schwarzschild spacetime and we survey its application to higher spin, free fields. To conclude we examine the future perspectives on the interplay between Hadamard states, algebraic quantum field theory and black hole physics.

### 2D Moving-Mirror Models Revisited: Equivalence Principle, Conformal Invariance, and Their Limitations
#### Stephen A. Fulling (Texas A&M University — USA)
Because all two-dimensional space-times are conformally flat and most massless field equations are conformally invariant, exact solutions are easy to find, even for reflection boundary conditions on arbitrary timelike curves ("mirror trajectories").  Such models played an important role in establishing the paradigm of quantum field theory in curved space-time in the 1970s, and they have recently reattracted attention in connection with radiation from black holes or their near environs.  The critical issues (not yet completely solved even for classical fields) are the correct formal definition and degree of physical reality of "radiation" when source and detector are in relative acceleration.  One arrives at apparently paradoxical conclusions such as that a stationary mirror radiates from the perspective of an accelerated observer.  Our conclusion is that such statements are correct (and necessary to satisfy principles of equivalence and general covariance), but one must be careful about combining them too literally with our flat-space and classical intuitions.

My principal collaborators in this work have been Paul Davies in the 1970s and Justin Wilson in the 2010s; Bill Unruh and Marlan Scully have had major influences.

### Particle detectors and purification partners for the observed particles
#### Masahiro Hotta (Tohoku University — Japan)
In quantum field theory, the term "particle" is defined as that which is observed by a particle detector, as emphasized by Unruh and DeWitt. We present a general formula for determining a complementary purification particle corresponding to the particle observed by the detector.

## Contributed Talks

### Nonperturbative Renormalization Group Flow for a Particle Detector
#### Níckolas de Aguiar Alves (Federal University of ABC — Brazil)
The functional renormalization group is a powerful tool to study nonperturbative physics, but it has not been much explored within quantum field theory in curved spacetime yet. On the other hand, particle detectors are an omnipresent tool within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and relativistic quantum information but are often treated only perturbatively. In this paper, we present the first computation of the functional renormalization group flow for a particle detector. The chosen model is an inertial Unruh–DeWitt detector in Minkowski spacetime, for simplicity. A new development in heat kernel techniques—the Taylor trick—is necessary to perform the calculations and it is important to carefully choose cutoffs that diverge at the ultraviolet limit in order to keep the beta functions finite. We compare our results with the MS-bar results at one-loop and find that both computations agree qualitatively, as expected.

### Unpacking Black Hole Complementarity
#### Siddharth Muthukrishnan (University of Pittsburgh — USA)
To what extent does the black hole information paradox lead to violations of quantum mechanics? I explain how black hole complementarity provides a framework to articulate how quantum characterizations of black holes can remain consistent despite the information paradox. I point out that there are two ways to cash out the notion of consistency in play here: an operational notion and a descriptive notion. These two ways of thinking about consistency lead to (at least) two principles of black hole complementarity: an operational principle and a descriptive principle. Our background philosophy of science regarding realism/instrumentalism might initially lead us to prefer one principle over the other. However, the recent physics literature, which applies tools from quantum information theory and quantum computational complexity theory to various thought experiments involving quantum systems in or around black holes, implies that the operational principle is successful where the descriptive principle is not. This then lets us see that for operationalists the black hole information paradox might no longer be pressing.

### The Idealization Paradox in Hawking Radiation
#### Dominic Ryder (London School of Economics — United Kingdom)
In this talk I argue that three mainstream derivations of Hawking radiation all contain an unresolved paradox. These are Hawking’s original derivation (1975), Fredenhagen and Haag’s mathematically “watertight” derivation (1990), and the algebraic approach (Dimock and Kay, 1987). The paradox is due to the fact that the derivations are carried out in a spacetime which does not model black hole evaporation whereas, given the existence of Hawking radiation, black holes are expected to evaporate. Therefore, one should be able to deidealize the derivations and carry them out on spacetimes which model black hole evaporation. However, assumptions essential for the derivations breakdown in evaporation spacetimes, and so it appears the idealization of non-evaporation is essential for these derivations. 

I first present and defend the existence of the idealization paradox by showing that for all three approaches, assumptions necessary for them to be carried out breakdown in evaporation spacetimes. Hawking himself recognized this problem and proposed an approximation regime to respond to it. Therefore, I next describe this proposal and argue that for each derivation it is non-trivial to show that Hawking radiation can be recovered in the approximation regime. For Hawking’s derivation the prospects of success for the approximation regime are very limited; for Fredenhagen and Haag’s the prospects are better; and for the algebraic approach the prospects are good.

Finally, canvas possible resolutions to the idealization paradox and argue that, given a resolution, we may learn about: the operation of idealizations in physics, how global structure encodes local structure in general relativity, the nature of Hawking radiation, and how science uses models to make progress.
