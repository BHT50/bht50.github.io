### Hadamard States and Black Holes: A story written at infinity
#### Claudio Dappiaggi (University of Pavia — Italy)
We review the cornerstones of a longstanding programme aimed at constructing Hadamard states for free quantum fields on asymptotically flat spacetimes by exploiting invariance under the action of the BMS asymptotic symmetry group. In particular we outline how this procedure has been used to give a rigorous construction of the Unruh state for a massless, conformally coupled, real scalar field on Schwarzschild spacetime and we survey its application to higher spin, free fields. To conclude we examine the future perspectives on the interplay between Hadamard states, algebraic quantum field theory and black hole physics.

### 2D Moving-Mirror Models Revisited: Equivalence Principle, Conformal Invariance, and Their Limitations
#### Stephen A. Fulling (Texas A&M University — USA)
Because all two-dimensional space-times are conformally flat and most massless field equations are conformally invariant, exact solutions are easy to find, even for reflection boundary conditions on arbitrary timelike curves ("mirror trajectories").  Such models played an important role in establishing the paradigm of quantum field theory in curved space-time in the 1970s, and they have recently reattracted attention in connection with radiation from black holes or their near environs.  The critical issues (not yet completely solved even for classical fields) are the correct formal definition and degree of physical reality of "radiation" when source and detector are in relative acceleration.  One arrives at apparently paradoxical conclusions such as that a stationary mirror radiates from the perspective of an accelerated observer.  Our conclusion is that such statements are correct (and necessary to satisfy principles of equivalence and general covariance), but one must be careful about combining them too literally with our flat-space and classical intuitions.

My principal collaborators in this work have been Paul Davies in the 1970s and Justin Wilson in the 2010s; Bill Unruh and Marlan Scully have had major influences.

### Particle detectors and purification partners for the observed particles
#### Masahiro Hotta (Tohoku University — Japan)
In quantum field theory, the term "particle" is defined as that which is observed by a particle detector, as emphasized by Unruh and DeWitt. We present a general formula for determining a complementary purification particle corresponding to the particle observed by the detector.
