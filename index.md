2023 marks fifty years of the publication of [``The four laws of black hole mechanics''](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01645742), a seminal paper by J. M. Bardeen, B. Carter and S. W. Hawking establishing the foundations of what would be known as black hole thermodynamics. In the advent of the golden wedding of black holes and thermodynamics, we are conducting an online event to gather the community and celebrate with minicourses and talks.
