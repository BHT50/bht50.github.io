  Hello, there! I'm Níck, a theoretical physicist. I just got my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](fisica.ufabc.edu.br/en/), a bit after getting my BSc at the [University of São Paulo's Institute of Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en). I have recently been studying how to use the functional renormalization group to understand nonperturbative phenomena within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and I am particularly attracted to the intersections of work happening in high energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitational physics.

Howdy!

I'm Rafael, as you can probably tell by the tag above.

I got my BSc in Physics at the [Federal University of Minas Gerais](https://www.fisica.ufmg.br/en/home-page/) and I am currently getting my MSc in Mathematical Physics at the [University of São Paulo](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en).

I am generally interested in mathematical aspects of quantum field theory and in the intersection between pure mathematics and theoretical physics. I am currently working on extending the description of Bell's inequalities in QFT to more general spacetimes and the consequences of such generalization.
