  Hello, there! I am Níckolas de Aguiar Alves, a theoretical physicist. I just got my MSc degree at the Federal University of ABC. I work in the interface between Quantum Mechanics and Gravitation. More specifically, I have recently been studying how to use the functional renormalization group to understand nonperturbative phenomena within quantum field theory in curved spacetime. I am particularly attracted to the intersections of work happening in high energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitational physics.
