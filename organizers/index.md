  Hello, there! I'm Níck, a theoretical physicist. I just got my MSc degree at the [Federal University of ABC](fisica.ufabc.edu.br/en/), a bit after getting my BSc at the [University of São Paulo's Institute of Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/en). I have recently been studying how to use the functional renormalization group to understand nonperturbative phenomena within quantum field theory in curved spacetime and I am particularly attracted to the intersections of work happening in high energy physics, mathematical physics, and gravitational physics.
